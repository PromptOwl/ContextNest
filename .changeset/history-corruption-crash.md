Fix a corrupt `history.yaml` taking down every vault-wide operation, and stop producing corrupt ones.

Surfaced while dogfooding: `ctx publish` threw `YAMLException: null byte is not allowed in input` from inside `findAllHistories`. One zero-filled history file — the residue of an interrupted non-atomic write — aborted the whole crawl, and with it the checkpoint seal, `ctx verify`, and the §7.3 rebuild.

- **`findAllHistories` no longer throws on an unparseable history file.** It skips it, the way `readHistory` already did. Skipping alone would be a silent pass, though: `verifyCheckpointChain` treats a missing history as "nothing to check", so a document with a torn history would have verified green. The method now takes an optional `onUnreadable(docId, reason)` callback; `verifyVaultIntegrity` and `ctx verify` use it to report a new `unreadable_history` integrity error (also added to the `context_verify` output schema). Schema-invalid histories, previously dropped without a word, are reported the same way.
- **`history.yaml` and `context_history.yaml` are now written durably** — temp file, `fsync`, rename over the target — instead of a truncate-in-place `writeFile` that leaves a zero-filled file if the process dies between the metadata extend and the data flush. Limited to the two hash-chain files: they are the integrity anchors and a torn one is unrecoverable, unlike a regenerable index. Temp names are unique per write (a shared `{path}.tmp` would make concurrent writers collide on ENOENT — reachable via `rebuildCheckpointHistory`, which writes `context_history.yaml` outside `withCheckpointLock`), and the rename retries briefly on `EPERM`/`EACCES`/`EBUSY`, which Windows raises when another handle holds the destination.

Compatibility: `findAllHistories`'s new parameter is optional, so existing callers are unchanged, and `unreadable_history` is an additive output enum member — no consumer in the repo switches exhaustively on the error type. The one behavioural change is intended: a vault holding an unparseable or schema-invalid `history.yaml` now reports `valid: false` where it previously reported green, because that document was never actually being verified.
